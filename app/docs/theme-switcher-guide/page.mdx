## Implement a Theme Switcher for Your Clerk Application
<br />
Clerk's components are designed to handle preset themes, which can be easily toggled between
using a theme switcher. This guide shows how to add a theme switcher to your Clerk application.
You'll learn how to create a theme toggle that seamlessly integrates with Clerk's components. 

This guide assumes you are using Next.js and Tailwind CSS and that you have already completed
the [Clerk Next.js Quickstart Guide](https://clerk.com/docs/quickstarts/nextjs).

### 1. Install Theme Management Package

Install `next-themes` to handle theme management.

```bash
npm install next-themes
```

This package will provide:
- Theme management utilities
- Built-in dark mode support
- Hydration handling
- System theme detection

### 2. Create a Theme Provider

Create a theme provider component that handles hydration mismatches between server
and client rendering. This is crucial for theme switching because the initial theme
state can differ between server and client. By waiting for the first client-side render,
we avoid visual flickering and ensure the correct theme is displayed.

```typescript:providers/theme-provider.tsx
'use client'

import * as React from 'react';
import { ThemeProvider as NextThemeProvider } from 'next-themes';

export function ThemeProvider({ children, ...props }: React.ComponentProps<typeof NextThemeProvider>) {
    const [mounted, setMounted] = React.useState(false);

    // Only render content after first client-side mount
    React.useEffect(() => {
        setMounted(true);
    }, []);

    // Return null on server-side and first render
    if (!mounted) return null;

    // Only render theme provider when we're on the client
    return <NextThemeProvider {...props}>{children}</NextThemeProvider>;
}
```

This provider:
- Prevents hydration mismatches between server and client
- Ensures consistent theme state across your application
- Provides theme management utilities through the `useTheme` hook

### 3. Configure Tailwind for Dark Mode

Configure your Tailwind CSS settings to support dark mode using the 'class' strategy.

```typescript:tailwind.config.ts
import type { Config } from "tailwindcss";

export default {
    // ... content configuration ...
    theme: {
        extend: {
            // ... other theme settings ...
        },
    },
    // ... other config options ...
    darkMode: 'class',
} satisfies Config;
```

Add base styles to your global CSS file to handle light and dark mode colors.
For this example, we'll use `black` and `white` as the colors for ease of demonstration,
but you can use any colors you want.

Clerk components handle their theming separately through the `appearance` prop, which we'll configure in the next step.

```css:app/globals.css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;

body {
    background-color: white;
    color: black;
}

:is(.dark body) {
    background-color: black;
    color: white;
}
```

### 4. Create a Clerk Theme Provider

Create a custom Clerk provider that responds to theme changes. The `appearance` prop controls
the theme of Clerk components (for configuration options, see the [Clerk Themes documentation](https://clerk.com/docs/customization/themes)).

```typescript:providers/clerk-provider.tsx
'use client'

import { ClerkProvider } from '@clerk/nextjs';
import { dark } from '@clerk/themes';
import { useTheme } from 'next-themes';

export default function _ClerkProvider({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
    const { resolvedTheme } = useTheme();

    return (
        <ClerkProvider appearance={resolvedTheme === 'dark' ? { baseTheme: dark } : undefined}>
            {children}
        </ClerkProvider>
    )
}
```

This provider:
- Uses `resolvedTheme` to detect the current theme state
- Applies Clerk's dark theme when dark mode is active
- Falls back to the default light theme otherwise

### 5. Wrap Your Application

Now wrap your application with both providers in your root layout. The Theme
Provider must wrap the Clerk Provider since we're using the `useTheme` hook in
our Clerk Provider.

```typescript:app/layout.tsx
import { ThemeProvider } from '@/providers/theme-provider'
import ClerkProvider from '@/providers/clerk-provider'

export default function RootLayout({
    children,
}: {
    children: React.ReactNode
}) {
    return (
        <html lang="en">
            <body>
                <ThemeProvider attribute="class" defaultTheme="light">
                    <ClerkProvider>
                        {children}
                    </ClerkProvider>
                </ThemeProvider>
            </body>
        </html>
    )
}
```

Note:
- `ThemeProvider` must be the outer provider
- `defaultTheme="light"` sets light mode as the default theme
- `attribute="class"` tells next-themes to use class-based dark mode
- `ClerkProvider` uses the theme context from `ThemeProvider`

### 6. Using Theme Aware Components

Now that your theme system is set up, you can create components that
respond to theme changes. 

Tailwind's dark mode styling uses the `dark:` prefix to define
styles for dark mode. When you add this prefix to any utility class,
that style will only be applied when dark mode is active. You can pair
any light mode class with its dark mode equivalent by adding the `dark:`
prefix to create a seamless theme switch.

For example, the following component will use `dark:bg-gray-900`
when dark mode is active and `bg-white` when light mode is active:

```tsx
function ExampleCard() {
    return (
        <div className="bg-white dark:bg-gray-900 text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100 p-4 rounded-lg">
            <h2 className="text-xl font-bold">Theme-Aware Component</h2>
            <p>This component changes appearance based on the current theme.</p>
        </div>
    );
}
```

Clerk components will automatically switch between light and dark themes based on your theme state.

```tsx
import { UserButton } from "@clerk/nextjs";

function Header() {
    return (
        <header className="flex justify-between p-4 bg-gray-100 dark:bg-gray-800">
            <h1>My App</h1>
            <UserButton />  {/* Automatically matches current theme */}
        </header>
    );
}
```

### 7. Create a Theme Switch Component

Create a component that toggles between themes. The `useTheme` hook from next-themes provides the
current theme state and a function to update it. You can use any appropriate interactive component
to toggle the theme state.

```typescript:components/ThemeSwitch.tsx
'use client';

import { useTheme } from 'next-themes';

export default function ThemeSwitch() {
    const { theme, setTheme } = useTheme();
    const isDark = theme === 'dark';
    
    return (
        <button
            onClick={() => setTheme(isDark ? 'light' : 'dark')}
            aria-label="Toggle dark mode"
        >
            {/* Add your preferred toggle UI here */}
        </button>
    );
}
```

The key elements for the theme switch implementation are:
- Using the `useTheme` hook to get and set the current theme
- Toggling between 'light' and 'dark' themes
- Providing proper ARIA labels for accessibility

You can customize the UI using a button, switch, or toggle component.
